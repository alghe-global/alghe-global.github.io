# Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```console
helm repo add alghe-global https://alghe-global.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo alghe-global` to see the charts.
